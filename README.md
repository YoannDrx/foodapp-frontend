#  📚 Food App

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

The goal of this challenge is to reproduce a recipe application based on mockups and an animated image showing the flow of screens, in order to go further into the concepts of navigation and styling with React Native.

You will need to replicate the style and behavior of the application, respecting the following constraints:

👉 Use the screens provided in the base code for each part of the application: HomeScreen for the home, SearchScreen for the list of recipes, RecipeScreen for the details of a recipe, and MyRecipeScreen for favorite recipes.

👉 The list of recipes will be retrieved from the data/recipes.js file, which exports an array of objects that should not be modified.

👉 Favorite recipes and associated quantities should be saved in the Redux store via a reducer in the reducers/favorites.js file.

This challenge is suitable for developers who want to improve their skills with React Native, Redux, and styling. Feel free to fork this project and start coding!
